# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems and Methodology

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this lab is the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle.
It contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class,
fare, and survival status.

## Machine Learning Problem
This is a **classification problem**.

The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster
based on available features.

## Target Variable
The target variable is **Survived**, where:
- 0 = Did not survive
- 1 = Survived

## Problem Statement
Given passenger information, the objective is to build a machine learning
model that can classify whether a passenger survived or not.
